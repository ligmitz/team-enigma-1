            Technology has become all pervasive.  It is all around us and is becoming part of us. Together with the rise of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) paradigm and enabling technologies, smart wearables and IoT-based garments can potentially have a lot of influence by harmonizing functionality and the delight created by fashion. Thus, smart clothes look for a balance among fashion, engineering, interaction, user experience, security etc.</p>
            <p>
             Nowadays, the rapid convergence of textile and electronics is enabling the seamless and massive integration of sensors into textiles. The potential of smart fabrics, which can communicate with smartphones to process biometric information such as heart rate, temperature, pulse oximetry along with the security features promises a new era for retail.

                Smart clothes can be created by embedding smart wearables into garments. Clothing is the only wearable that adjusts to our everyday lifestyle over the course of a lifetime. It represents a strong candidate to become the next interface between the real and the digital world. In addition, textiles are essentially the ultimate wearable medium: form-fitting, adaptable and usually in direct contact with our body.

            <p>
                Furthermore, shirts are more natural to wear than a wristband or a chest strap, and are able to track more biometric signals due to the larger and vital area of skin they cover. Thus, smart clothes are able to monitor, document, augment and actuate on our lives providing unprecedented opportunities for tackling global societal challenges in areas like smart and crowdsourced health, ageing, work safety or personal productivity.
