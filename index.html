                Introduction
            </div>
            <p>
                Technology has become all pervasive.  It is all around us and is becoming part of us. Together with the rise of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) paradigm and enabling technologies, smart wearables and IoT-based garments can potentially have a lot of influence by harmonizing functionality and the delight created by fashion. Thus, smart clothes look for a balance among fashion, engineering, interaction, user experience, security etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nowadays, the rapid convergence of textile and electronics is enabling the seamless and massive integration of sensors into textiles. The potential of smart fabrics, which can communicate with smartphones to process biometric information such as heart rate, temperature, pulse oximetry along with the security features promises a new era for retail.

                Our Concept
            </div>
            <p>
                Smart clothes can be created by embedding smart wearables into garments. Clothing is the only wearable that adjusts to our everyday lifestyle over the course of a lifetime. It represents a strong candidate to become the next interface between the real and the digital world. In addition, textiles are essentially the ultimate wearable medium: form-fitting, adaptable and usually in direct contact with our body. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, shirts are more natural to wear than a wristband or a chest strap, and are able to track more biometric signals due to the larger and vital area of skin they cover. Thus, smart clothes are able to monitor, document, augment and actuate on our lives providing unprecedented opportunities for tackling global societal challenges in areas like smart and crowdsourced health, ageing, work safety or personal productivity.

                Our monitoring system combines the utility of advance sensors and wireless communication techniques. These include sensors that sense the basic health signs of the body like temperature sensor, pulse sensor and the blood oximeter.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are many advanced sensors like Airflow sensor, EEG, EMG, ECG, breathing rate sensor, GSR (Galvanic skin response), blood pressure sensor etc., but their use is limited by the fact that the smart clothing should be more comfortable and convenient for daily wear.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to this, a distress button is added to provide immediate assistance under the conditions of imminent threat or misadventure. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Apart from health monitoring, monitoring of movement and location can also be achieved by the use of 9-axis sensor and the GPS module, respectively which cannot be implemented into our current prototype due to economic issues.

                    For being correlated to the health care system through IoT, health specialists can improve diagnostic accuracy as they are getting all the necessary usersâ€™ health data at hand. In a word, we can say that it provides monitoring of users continuously and remotely.

                    By using this system, we can get an estimated result based on user wellness. Moreover, it will be less error, collect data in less time and more efficient than any human achievement.

                    The monitoring system, since it continuously evaluates the status of the individual, helps prevent deterioration of the condition of the user into critical state, in case of some ailment or misadventure.
