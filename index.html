            Technology has become all pervasive.  It is all around us and is becoming part of us. Together with the rise of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) paradigm and enabling technologies, smart wearables and IoT-based garments can potentially have a lot of influence by harmonizing functionality and the delight created by fashion. Thus, smart clothes look for a balance among fashion, engineering, interaction, user experience, security etc. Nowadays, the rapid convergence of textile and electronics is enabling the seamless and massive integration of sensors into textiles. The potential of smart fabrics, which can communicate with smartphones to process biometric information such as heart rate, temperature, pulse oximetry along with the security features promises a new era for retail.
